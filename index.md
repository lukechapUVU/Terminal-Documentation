1. What is the terminal? Why is it an important tool for a web developer?
*The terminal is an enviroment where the developer gives text commands to the computer and receives text outputs of the computer's response to the command given. There is no GUI for a terminal.*

2. For you, what are some important built-in commands to know. What do they do, and why are they important? (At least 5)
- *cd - allows the user to navigate between directories*
- *ls - shows the user all of the files and folders within the current directory*
- *rm - removes specified files or directories*
- *mv - moves specified files or directories*
- *mkdir - creates new directories*

3. What is the root?
*The root is default user which has access to all of the files and commands in the terminal*

4. What is the path?
*The path is a string separated by slashes wherein each component between the slashes is a directory that leads to the current directory*

5. What is the present working directory?
*The present working directory is where all of the commands in the terminal are being executed*

6. What is the bin? How does it work?
*The bin is a directory that contains user binaries, executable files, and single user Linux commands. A binary package is an application package that contains executables, build from source code, and are not reversible. Binary packages are able to hide source code and are not reversible.*

7. Write about at least two new things you have personally learned about the command line.
*The two things I learned about the command line were from the class we had with Jake Oldroyd. The first of this being when he called ls -l to show the long list and how he explained that anything in that list that starts with d is a directory. Jake taught a lot more about navigating through your directories. I had a slight understanding of the . .. and / notation, but Jake was able to explain it in a much better way than what I had understood it as before.*
